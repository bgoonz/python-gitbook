# Employee Manager



## Coding Challenge: Employee Management

This code is the very beginning of an employee management system for a company. There are three failing tests that need to be fixed.

* The test code can be assumed to be perfect. Only edit `employees.py`.
* The code is Python 2 and Python 3 compatible and has no dependencies.

#### Running the tests

```text
python -m unittests tests

```
