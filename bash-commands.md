### What Cheat Sheets are NOT a Replacement For

Your wall could be full of cheat sheets. You shelves full of the most up to date coding books. You could be subscribed to all the best online Python courses. But none of this matters if you don’t put in the work.

To become a coder, you need to sit down and actually write code. It’s best to do it every day. This ensures you are making continuous progress. Even 20 minutes per day adds up to 121 hours over a year – 3 working weeks!

It doesn’t matter what you do. You can read over a cheat sheet, work through a course, or sit down and try to build something you think is cool. Whatever it is, the most important thing is that you typing Python into your computer. Cheat sheets are here to make that process easier, not as a replacement for it.

Now let’s look at some other things to help you on your Python journey.   


### Cheat Sheet Alternatives

We all learn in different ways. What works well for one person may be terrible for another. So here are some alternatives to cheat sheets.

#### Flashcards

Flashcards took me from amateur to professional. I recommend that you write down all the information you want to remember on flashcards. You could create them in real life. But far better is the free app [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/). It works on your phone, tablet and computer. They use a scientifically proven spaced repetition system to help you learn. This means it shows you flashcards you find difficult more often than the ones you find easy. Instead of scrolling through social media next time you’re waiting in line, why not answer some coding questions that you wrote?

#### Personalised Cheat Sheets

The cheat sheets in this article are great to give you inspiration. But they may include information that you already know. Plus, you’re 10x more likely to remember something if you’ve written it down and created it yourself. So, at the end of a topic you’ve learned, make a 1-page cheat sheet of all the most important info. This ensures you only include information that’s relevant to you and that it’s valuable every time you look at it.

#### Projects

At Finxter, we believe in the power of project-based learning. Programming is supposed to be fun and interesting. What’s more fun than building something you think is amazing?

Come up with an idea and start creating it. If you get stuck, google is your best friend. There is so much content out there and so many wonderful communities. They are happy to help aspiring coders like you. Start typing and playing and see what happens. You’ll learn loads and have a lot of fun too!  
If you want to learn Python as quickly as possible through project-based learning, check out our [Python Freelancer course](https://www.digistore24.com/redir/261950/adsmurphy/).![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/fJbBur22DtU/hqdefault.jpg)

### Summary

Cheat sheets are a wonderful way to apply the 80/20 principle. You only need to put in 20% of the learning effort and you get 80% of the results. These helped me when I was first learning Python and I know they will do the same for you. Best of luck!
