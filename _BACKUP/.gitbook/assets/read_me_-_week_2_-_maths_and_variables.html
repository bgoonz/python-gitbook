    <p>
      This unit looks at how computers do basic maths. This is a process (it
      happens ‘inside’ the computer).
    </p>
    <p>
      We start off by learning about the operators used for simple maths.
      Multiplication &amp; division use different operators to paper based
      maths. We also see the + operator used for another purpose here as well.
    </p>
    <p>
      / is used for division, but it returns a decimal result (known as a
      <strong>float</strong>). Python also lets us use // to perform
      <strong>floor division</strong> - where it ignores any decimal and just
      returns the whole number part of the answer (known as an integer, or int).
    </p>
    <p>
      Task 1 uses set numbers to perform maths so that students can concentrate
      on learning how to use the operators.
    </p>
    <p>
      Task 2 reintroduces variables, but this time as placeholders for numbers
      (no speech marks because we are treating them as numbers, not text).
      Again, the variables are assigned in the code. Be aware that the code will
      not work as students expect. Because all input is treated as strings
      (text) the number the user inputs will also be treated as text so will be
      duplicated 10 times instead of multiplied by 10. Use the slides to show
      students how to convert input to an integer (casting).
    </p>
    <p>
      Task 3 brings in input. We go back to using strings so that students can
      see how the contents of a variable can be changed as the program runs. Up
      to now we’ve not done this, the contents of each variable have not changed
      so you might need to slow down here and guide students line by line
      through the code getting them to write what is stored in each variable at
      each stage of the code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Task 4 is the homework challenge - a program that gets input and
      calculates the area of a rectangle. This combines everything we’ve learned
      about input, numbers, maths and variables.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are some extra credit challenges here if you have students who are
      racing ahead. Be careful here though, it’s more valuable to make them
      comment their code thoroughly before they move on than rush through the
      tasks.
