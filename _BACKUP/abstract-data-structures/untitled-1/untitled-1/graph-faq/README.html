    <p>
      A Graph is a data structure that models objects and pairwise relationships
      between them with nodes and edges. For example: Users and friendships,
      locations and paths between them, parents and children, etc.

      Why is it important to learn Graphs?
      <a id="why-is-it-important-to-learn-graphs"></a>
    </h4>
    <p>
      Graphs represent relationships between data. Anytime you can identify a
      relationship pattern, you can build a graph and often gain insights
      through a traversal. These insights can be very powerful, allowing you to
      find new relationships, like users who have a similar taste in music or
      purchasing.

      How many types of graphs are there?
      <a id="how-many-types-of-graphs-are-there"></a>
    </h4>
    <p>
      Graphs can be directed or undirected, cyclic or acyclic, weighted or
      unweighted. They can also be represented with different underlying
      structures including, but not limited to, adjacency lists, adjacency
      matrices, object and pointers, or a custom solution.

      It depends on the implementation. (<a
        href="https://github.com/LambdaSchool/Graphs/tree/master/objectives/graph-representations"
        >Graph Representations</a
      >). Before choosing an implementation, it is wise to consider the
      tradeoffs and complexities of the most commonly used operations.
