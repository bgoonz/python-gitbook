      Linear Data Structures <a id="linear-data-structures"></a>
    </h4>
    <p>
      Linear data structures store elements in a sequential manner. These are
      the most fundamental and widely used data structures.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Array/List</strong> – An array or list is a linear data
        structure where elements are stored in a sequential manner, numbered
        from 0 to n-1, where n is the size of the array. The array elements can
        be accessed using their index.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Stacks</strong> – A stack is a linear data structure that stores
        data in a <code>Last In, First Out</code> (LIFO) manner.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Queues</strong> – A data structure that stores data in a
        <code>First In, First Out</code> (FIFO) manner.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Linked Lists</strong> – A linear data structure that stores
        elements sequentially but cannot be accessed directly using an index. It
        consists of links to the next item, along with the data.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="non-linear-data-structures">
      Non-Linear Data Structures <a id="non-linear-data-structures"></a>
    </h4>
    <p>
      Non-Linear data structures are more complex data structures, that are not
      sequential in manner.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Trees</strong> – Trees store data in a tree-like manner. They
        consist of a root, which contains the data and links to children nodes.
        The children nodes may in turn contain more children. They are the
        building blocks of many other Data Structures.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Heaps</strong> – A heap is a tree, which is used as a priority
        queue. There are max-heaps, and min-heaps that contain the maximum value
        and the minimum value at the root node, respectively.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Hash Tables</strong> – Hash Tables are data structures that
        contain key-value pairs. They use the concept of hashing to determine
        the keys in the tables. Usually used for quick access of values.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Graphs</strong> – Graphs are complex data structures that
        implement a collection of nodes, connected together by vertices.
      </li>
    </ul>

      Python Collections and In-Built Data Structures
      <a id="python-collections-and-in-built-data-structures"></a>
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Tuples</strong> – They are sequential data structures, that are
        similar to lists, but they’re immutable.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Dictionary</strong> – Dictionaries are python-specific data
        structures that are similar to hashtables, and are used for quick access
        of values.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sets</strong> – A collection of unordered distinct elements,
        that have quick access time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Collections</strong> – Collections are a group of optimized
        implementations for data structures like dictionaries, maps, tuples,
        queues.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Now that we have an overview of data structures, let’s delve into the
      nuances of each of them in the upcoming articles of the series. Here are
      some resources to get you started with interview and programming
      preparation.
    </p>
    <h4 id="choose-a-platform">
      Choose a Platform <a id="choose-a-platform"></a>
    </h4>
    <p>
      There are numerous platforms like
      <a href="https://leetcode.com/">LeetCode</a>,
      <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">HackerRank</a>,
      <a href="https://www.interviewbit.com/">InterviewBit</a>,
      <a href="https://www.topcoder.com/">TopCoder</a>,
      <a href="https://www.hackerearth.com/">HackerEarth</a>,
      <a href="https://www.codechef.com/">CodeChef</a>,
      <a href="https://codeforces.com/">CodeForces</a>,
      <a href="https://www.spoj.com/">SPOJ</a>, etc. to learn programming. Out
      of these, after a lot of trial and error I felt that a combination of
      HackerRank and LeetCode worked really well for preparing for interviews.
    </p>
    <p><strong>HackerRank</strong></p>
    <p>
      HackerRank is amazing because it has customized tracks for each
      programming language, and one each for data structures and algorithms.
      There are also customized filters for each DS type like Stack, Queue, etc.
    </p>
    <p><strong>LeetCode</strong></p>
    <p>
      LeetCode is an excellent website for company-specific preparation. If you
      pay for LeetCode Premium, you get company-specific questions. This is
      great for preparing for companies like FaceBook, Microsoft, NetFlix,
      Amazon, Apple, Google, etc. They also have contests and real-time mock
      interviews that boost your confidence and skills.

      Implement the Data Structures from Scratch
      <a id="implement-the-data-structures-from-scratch"></a>
    </h4>
    <p>
      By personal experience, implementing the data structures from scratch
      helps a lot. It helps you to understand the data structure in detail and
      helps in debugging, in case you run into any errors. Python offers
      in-build implementation for many data structures, but it is better to
      learn how to implement it at least once.
