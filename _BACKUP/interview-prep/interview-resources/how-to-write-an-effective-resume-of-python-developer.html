    <p>How to Write an Effective Resume of Python Developer</p>
    <p>
      With the world’s orientation towards digital technology, The Python
      programming language has raised its value. It has overshadowed many
      occupations and Python developers have numerous opportunities for career
      growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      With knowledge of Python programming language, you can work in innovative
      fields such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data
      science. However, to get there you first need to gain the attention of
      employers. That’s when the resume steps in.
    </p>
    <p>
      A resume presents the first impression that hiring managers make of you.
      How you write your resume will determine whether you’ll have a chance to
      win them over at the interview or you’ll end up in the “don’t contact”
      pile. If you are ready to get some job interviews scheduled, here are the
      tips you should follow when writing your resume.
    </p>
    <h3 id="customize-the-resume-to-job-description">
      Customize the Resume to Job Description
    </h3>
    <p>
      While job descriptions usually all sound pretty much the same, you should
      customize your resume. There is always a way to make your resume more
      suitable for individual job positions. Instead of typical generalization,
      adapt your resume before you click the send button.
    </p>
    <p>
      Start with creating a template with all the basic information that all
      employers require. Later, you can frame the resume based on specifications
      that different companies seek for. For example, if an employer requires at
      least two years of experience, your resume must contain specific job
      experiences that show that you have fulfilled that condition. Otherwise,
      don’t waste time on that application. One of the biggest mistakes that
      many job applicants make is including their job experience that has
      nothing to do with the occupation they pursue. The fact that you worked at
      McDonald’s when you were sixteen won’t influence the employer to give you
      the job of a Python developer.
    </p>
    <h3 id="choose-the-layout-based-on-your-experience">
      Choose the Layout Based on Your Experience
    </h3>
    <p>
      The dilemma that worries many resume-makers is how to form the resume.
      When choosing a layout for a Python developer resume you will encounter
      three options:
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        Chronological layout – Lists your experiences in chronological order
      </li>
      <li>
        Reverse chronological layout – Puts the focus on the relevant
        experiences like a timeline (starting from the last job position)
      </li>
      <li>Functional layout – Emphasizes your skills</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The most common form is the chronological layout. However, what makes
      reverse chronological layout increasingly popular is that it highlights
      your most recent experience. This works best if your last job position was
      a Python developer as that would instantly show the employer that you have
      experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      The functional layout can be tricky as it demands creativity. The
      situation in which this format is a good choice is when you don’t have
      real work experience but you do have strong skills that depict you as a
      promising developer.
    </p>
    <h3 id="keep-it-concise">Keep it Concise</h3>
    <p>
      The length of the resume has always been a troublesome topic. People
      usually aim to make the resume longer so that it seems like they have more
      experience. That’s not such a good idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      A national survey conducted by
      <a
        href="http://press.careerbuilder.com/2018-08-24-Employers-Share-Their-Most-Outrageous-Resume-Mistakes-and-Instant-Deal-Breakers-in-a-New-CareerBuilder-Study"
        >Harris Poll for CareerBuilder</a
      >
      showed that concise resumes have more than an 80% chance of being
      accepted. A two-page resume is claimed to have the perfect length.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presenting yourself in a concise form will keep the reader’s attention
      until the end of the resume. Keep in mind that hiring managers go through
      at least dozens of resumes and they won’t have the concentration or desire
      to read essay-like CVs.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you can’t manage to present the information concisely, you can always
      turn to writing and editing professionals. For example, experts that work
      for <a href="https://bestessay.education/">BestEssayEducation</a> can
      rephrase some points for a cleaner look. Or, you can use editing tools
      like <a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com/">HemingwayEditor</a>.
    </p>
    <h3 id="avoid-cliché-terms">Avoid Cliché Terms</h3>
    <p>
      Did you know that clichéd and generic terms that hiring managers have seen
      in almost all resumes increase your chance of not getting the job by 50%?
      Companies that look for Python developers who are experts in their job and
      great team players won’t be drawn to dull and typical resumes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luckily,
      <a
        href="http://www.goodhousekeeping.co.uk/consumer-advice/money-and-work/write-a-cv-mistakes"
        >New College of the Humanities</a
      >
      has researched top cliché terms that you shouldn’t use in your resume.
      They surveyed 2,000 employers and the terms that came up as repelling are
      the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Works well under pressure</li>
      <li>Excellent written communication skills</li>
      <li>Can work independently</li>
      <li>Problem solver</li>
      <li>Hard worker</li>
      <li>Good communicator</li>
      <li>Proactive</li>
      <li>Enthusiastic</li>
      <li>Team player</li>
      <li>Good listener</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A generic resume will hurt your possibility to stand out and attract the
      attention of potential employers.
    </p>
    <h3 id="pay-attention-to-readability">Pay Attention to Readability</h3>
    <p>
      According to
      <a
        href="http://press.careerbuilder.com/2018-08-24-Employers-Share-Their-Most-Outrageous-Resume-Mistakes-and-Instant-Deal-Breakers-in-a-New-CareerBuilder-Study"
        >research</a
      >, resumes that have typos or bad grammar have the highest chance of
      getting instantly rejected (77%). Meaning, that your expertise can fall in
      the shadow of a poorly written resume.
    </p>
    <p>

      doesn’t mean that you can be careless. If you want to ensure that no

    <h3 id="dont-go-overboard-with-the-design">
      Don’t Go Overboard with the Design
    </h3>
    <p>
      The first thing that hiring managers will notice about your resume is the
      design. Using a flashy and chaotic design doesn’t really say “this is the
      best Python developer for this company.” Simplicity is the safest and most
      elegant choice when it comes to design. Keep it simple and consistent with
      the style and you won’t have to worry about whether the design will send
      the wrong message.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Here are a few suggestions when it comes to resume design:</li>
      <li>Underline headers and sections</li>
      <li>Use fonts that are easy to read (Times New Roman, Arial, etc.)</li>
      <li>
        The recommendable font size is 12 (or 11 if you want to fit information
        within 2 pages)
      </li>
      <li>Use bullets for listing</li>
      <li>Use bold text for emphasis (for job titles for example)</li>
      <li>
        List qualifications and skills with bullets rather than stating them in
        a paragraph
      </li>
    </ul>
