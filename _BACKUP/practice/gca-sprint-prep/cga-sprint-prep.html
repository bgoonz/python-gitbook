    <p>
      The GCA is a proctored assessment that provides a certified report you can
      use when applying for jobs. It is a standardized assessment that provides
      a high-level score for a candidate’s programming skill. It maps
      programming skills to a score from 300 to 850, combining information about
      problem-solving and code-writing skills and speed and code quality. It is
      a measure meant to give recruiters, hiring managers, and educators – as
      well as the test-takers themselves – a quick view of the test-taker’s
      skills. Taking the assessment will be a data point that informs how
      career-ready you are and how you can continue to improve during Labs and
      Job Search. One key way that hiring managers are assessing new hires
      during remote work is with automated technical assessment testing, like
      GCA. This is why we will continue to evaluate how our students perform on
      these types of tests.

      Be sure to take the test using the link above, and sign up with your
      <span class="citation" data-cites="lambdastudents"
        >[@lambdastudents \(Links to an external site.\)]</span

      your results with Lambda so we can get your score back.
    </p>
    <p>You will also need the following to take the test:</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        Grab your photo ID. Have a government-issued photo ID ready to show
        (like driver’s license or passport).
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare your computer. Make sure you have the following: Chrome or
        Firefox, a reliable internet connection, webcam and microphone.
      </li>
      <li>
        Time and space. Reserve 1 hour and 10 minutes to take the test somewhere
        quiet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Share your webcam and desktop. When prompted, share your entire desktop
        screen as well as your webcam. Do not end video or close any windows or
        screensharing until the test is finished.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Again, you must take the test with your

    <p>
      Each test draws from a pool of question types. There are four tasks for
      you to solve. Each test contains a very basic task, a simple data
      manipulation task, an implementation task (requires writing at least 25-40
      lines of code, but the description clearly explains what needs to be
      done), and a problem-solving task (where you need to come up with the
      approach yourself).

    <p>
      The GCA test is limited to 1 hour and 10 minutes, starting from the time
      you begin the test.
    </p>
    <h3 id="can-i-retake-the-gca">
      Can I retake the GCA? <a id="can-i-retake-the-gca"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>You can retake the GCA after a 2 week ‘cool off’ period.</p>
    <h3 id="why-is-the-test-proctored">
      Why is the test proctored? <a id="why-is-the-test-proctored"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      The test is proctored to guarantee the integrity of the assessment. Since
      GCA assessments are certified and shared across multiple companies,
      automated proctoring is required for the GCA. Without automated
      proctoring, for example, someone else can take the test for the given
      candidate and provide inaccurate test results. Note that Lambda School
      does not share your results with companies, but you may do so if you
      choose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Virtual proctoring data is reviewed by CodeSignal only and is stored for
      no more than 15 days.

      After the test, you can share your certification directly with employers
      or add it to your LinkedIn profile!
