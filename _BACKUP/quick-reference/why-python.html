    <p>
      Python in simple words is a
      <strong>High-Level Dynamic Programming Language</strong> which is
      <strong>interpreted</strong>. Guido van Rossum , the father of Python had
      simple goals in mind when he was developing it,
      <strong>easy looking code, readable and open source.</strong> Python is
      ranked as the 3rd most prominent language followed by JavaScript and Java
      in a survey held in 2018 by Stack Overflow which serves proof to it being
      the most growing language.

    <p>
      Python is currently my favorite and most preferred language to work on
      because of its <em>simplicity, powerful libraries, and readability</em>.
      You may be an old school coder or may be completely new to programming,
      Python is the best way to get started!

      Python is currently my favorite and most preferred language to work on
      because of its <em>simplicity, powerful libraries, and readability</em>.
      You may be an old school coder or may be completely new to programming, is
      the best way to get started!
    </p>
    <p>Python provides features listed below :</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Simplicity:</strong> Think less of the syntax of the language
        and more of the code.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Open Source:</strong> A powerful language and it is free for
        everyone to use and alter as needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Portability:</strong> Python code can be shared and it would
        work the same way it was intended to. Seamless and hassle-free.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Being Embeddable &amp; Extensible:</strong> Python can have
        snippets of other languages inside it to perform certain functions.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Being Interpreted:</strong> The worries of large memory tasks
        and other heavy CPU tasks are taken care of by Python itself leaving you
        to worry only about coding.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Huge amount of libraries:</strong> Data Science Python has you
        covered. Web Development? Python still has you covered. Always.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Object Orientation:</strong> Objects help breaking-down complex
        real-life problems into such that they can be coded and solved to obtain
        solutions.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      To sum it up, Python has a <strong>simple syntax</strong>, is
      <strong>readable</strong>, and has
      <strong>great community support</strong>. You may now have the question,
      What can you do if you know Python? Well, you have a number of options to
      choose from.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Data Scientist</li>
      <li>Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence</li>
      <li>Internet of Things</li>
      <li>Web Development</li>
      <li>Data Visualization</li>
      <li>Automation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Now when you know that Python has such an amazing feature set, why don’t
      we get started with the Python Basics?
    </p>
    <p>
      To get started off with the Python Basics, you need to first
      <strong>install Python</strong> in your system right? So let’s do that
      right now! You should know that most <strong>Linux</strong> and
      <strong>Unix</strong> distributions these days come with a version of
      Python out of the box. To set yourself up, you can follow this
