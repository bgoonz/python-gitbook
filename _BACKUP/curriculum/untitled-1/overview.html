    <p>
      In this sprint, you will learn about graphs. These data structures are
      part of the critical computer science fundamentals that interviewers
      expect you to be comfortable with during the technical interview process.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, we will teach you about the technical interview process,
      best practices for interviews, getting unstuck, and overcoming imposter
      syndrome during an interview. As you complete this sprint and the computer
      science curriculum, you should feel prepared to tackle the technical
      interview process successfully.

    <p>
      In this module, you will learn about graph properties, graph
      representations, and how to build Graph and Vertex classes to construct
      your graphs in Python.
    </p>
    <h3 id="graphs-ii">Graphs II <a id="graphs-ii"></a></h3>
    <p>
      In this module, you will learn about breadth-first search, depth-first
      search, and implementing both of these techniques in code.
