      <strong>Depth-first search (DFS)</strong> is an
      <a href="https://brilliant.org/wiki/algorithm/">algorithm</a> for
      searching a
      <a
        href="https://brilliant.org/wiki/depth-first-search-dfs/%28https://brilliant.org/wiki/graphs/%29"
        >graph</a
      >
      or <a href="https://brilliant.org/wiki/trees-basic/">tree</a> data
      structure. The algorithm starts at the root (top) node of a tree and goes
      as far as it can down a given branch (path), then backtracks until it
      finds an unexplored path, and then explores it. The algorithm does this
      until the entire graph has been explored. Many problems in computer
      science can be thought of in terms of graphs. For example, analyzing
      networks, mapping routes, scheduling, and finding
      <a href="https://brilliant.org/wiki/spanning-trees/">spanning trees</a>
      are graph problems. To analyze these problems,
      <a href="https://brilliant.org/wiki/graph-search-algorithm/"
        >graph-search algorithms</a
      >
      like depth-first search are useful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Depth-first searches are often used as subroutines in other more complex
      algorithms. For example, the
      <a href="https://brilliant.org/wiki/matching-algorithms/"
        >matching algorithm</a
      >, <a href="https://brilliant.org/wiki/hopcroft-karp/">Hopcroft–Karp</a>,
      uses a DFS as part of its algorithm to help to find a
      <a href="https://brilliant.org/wiki/matching/">matching</a> in a graph.
      DFS is also used in
      <a href="https://brilliant.org/wiki/traversals/">tree-traversal</a>
      algorithms, also known as tree searches, which have applications in the
      <a href="https://brilliant.org/wiki/travelling-salesman-problem/"

      <p><strong>How do you solve a maze?</strong></p>
      <p>
        Depth-first search is a common way that many people naturally approach
        solving problems like mazes. First, we select a path in the maze (for
        the sake of the example, let’s choose a path according to some rule we
        lay out ahead of time) and we follow it until we hit a dead end or reach
        the finishing point of the maze. If a given path doesn’t work, we
        backtrack and take an alternative path from a past junction, and try
        that path. Below is an animation of a DFS approach to solving this maze.

    <p>
      The main strategy of depth-first search is to explore deeper into the
      graph whenever possible. Depth-first search explores edges that come out
      of the most recently discovered vertex, ss. Only edges going to unexplored
      vertices are explored. When all of ss’s edges have been explored, the
      search backtracks until it reaches an unexplored neighbor. This process
      continues until all of the vertices that are reachable from the original
      source vertex are discovered. If there are any unvisited vertices,
      depth-ﬁrst search selects one of them as a new source and repeats the
      search from that vertex. The algorithm repeats this entire process until
      it has discovered every vertex. This algorithm is careful not to repeat
      vertices, so each vertex is explored once. DFS uses a
      <a href="https://brilliant.org/wiki/stacks/">stack</a> data structure to
      keep track of vertices.

        <li>Recursively visit each unvisited vertex attached to ss.</li>

      Below are examples of pseudocode and Python code implementing DFS both
      recursively and non-recursively. This algorithm generally uses a
      <a href="https://brilliant.org/wiki/stacks/">stack</a> in order to keep
      track of visited nodes, as the last node seen is the next one to be
      visited and the rest are stored to be visited later.

      DFS can also be implemented using recursion, which greatly reduces the
      number of lines of code.

    <p>
      It is common to modify the algorithm in order to keep track of the edges
      instead of the vertices, as each edge describes the nodes at each end.
      This is useful when one is attempting to reconstruct the traversed tree
      after processing each node. In case of a forest or a group of trees, this
      algorithm can be expanded to include an outer loop that iterates over all
      trees in order to process every single node.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are three different strategies for implementing DFS:
      <em>pre-order</em>, <em>in-order</em>, and <em>post-order</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Pre-order</strong> DFS works by visiting the current node and
      successively moving to the left until a leaf is reached, visiting each
      node on the way there. Once there are no more children on the left of a
      node, the children on the right are visited. This is the most standard DFS
      algorithm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of visiting each node as it traverses down a tree, an
      <strong>in-order</strong> algorithm finds the leftmost node in the tree,
      visits that node, and subsequently visits the parent of that node. It then
      goes to the child on the right and finds the next leftmost node in the
      tree to visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <strong>post-order</strong> strategy works by visiting the leftmost leaf
      in the tree, then going up to the parent and down the second leftmost leaf
      in the same branch, and so on until the parent is the last node to be
      visited within a branch. This type of algorithm prioritizes the processing
      of leaves before roots in case a goal lies at the end of a tree.
    </p>
    <h3 id="complexity-of-depth-first-search">
      Complexity of Depth-first Search
    </h3>
    <p>
      Depth-first search visits every vertex once and checks every edge in the
      graph once. Therefore, DFS complexity is O(V + E)O(V+E). This assumes that
      the graph is represented as an
      <a href="https://brilliant.org/wiki/graphs-intermediate/"
        >adjacency list</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p><strong>DFS vs BFS</strong></p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://brilliant.org/wiki/breadth-first-search-bfs/"
        >Breadth-first search</a
      >
      is less space-efficient than depth-first search because BFS keeps a
      priority queue of the entire frontier while DFS maintains a few pointers
      at each level.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it is known that an answer will likely be found far into a tree, DFS is
      a better option than BFS. BFS is good to use when the depth of the tree
      can vary or if a single answer is needed—for example, the shortest path in
      a tree. If the entire tree should be traversed, DFS is a better option.
    </p>
    <p>
      BFS always returns an optimal answer, but this is not guaranteed for DFS.
