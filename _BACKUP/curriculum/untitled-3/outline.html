    <p>
      During this sprint, we will introduce you to some fundamental Computer
      Science fundamentals. First, we will introduce you to Python (the language
      we will be using throughout Computer Science). Second, you will learn
      about Lambda’s Problem-Solving Framework, which we call U.P.E.R. Third,
      you will learn about Big O notation and analyzing an algorithm’s time and
      space complexity. Last, you will learn about arrays and in-place and
      out-of-place algorithms.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of these topics lay down a crucial base for the other three sprints in
      Computer Science. You will rely on your Python skills, problem-solving
      abilities, ability to analyze time and space complexity, and your mental
      model for computer memory throughout the rest of the course.
    </p>
    <h3 id="python-i">Python I <a id="python-i"></a></h3>
    <p>
      In this module, you will begin to learn the fundamentals of the Python
      programming language. Additionally, you will learn about the U.P.E.R.
      Problem-Solving framework and best practices for asking for help. After
      completing this module, you will have all the basics that you need to get
      started using Python to solve algorithmic code challenges and deepen your
      understanding and skill set related to programming.
    </p>
    <h3 id="python-ii">Python II <a id="python-ii"></a></h3>
    <p>
      In this module, you will continue to learn the fundamentals of the Python
      programming language and put the U.P.E.R. Problem-Solving framework into
      practice. These skills are crucial as you encounter harder and harder code
      challenges in preparation for the technical interview process.
    </p>
    <h3 id="python-iii">Python III <a id="python-iii"></a></h3>
    <p>
      This module will teach about mutability vs. immutability, time complexity
      analysis, and space complexity analysis. These topics are incredibly
      crucial for optimizing the algorithms that you write and ensuring that we
      prepare you for the technical interview process.
    </p>
    <h3 id="python-iv">Python IV <a id="python-iv"></a></h3>
    <p>
      In this module, you will learn about static arrays, dynamic arrays, and
      the difference between an in-place algorithm and an out-of-place
      algorithm.
