    <p>
      In this sprint, you will learn about number bases, character encoding, and
      how values are stored in memory. We’ll also talk all about hash tables, a
      very powerful data structure for getting more performance and flexibility
      out of your algorithms. Finally, we’ll look at optimizing searching
      through data, as well as the powerful programming technique of recursion.

      Number Bases and Character Encoding
      <a id="number-bases-and-character-encoding"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      This module will teach about RAM, number bases, fixed-width integers, how
      arrays are stored in memory, and character encoding. These basics allow
      you to better understand how other data structures are stored in memory
      and have an intuitive sense of the time complexity of specific data
      structures’ operations.
    </p>
    <h3 id="hash-tables-i">Hash Tables I <a id="hash-tables-i"></a></h3>
    <p>
      In this module, you will learn about the properties of hash tables, hash
      functions, and how to implement a hash table in Python. Hash tables are
      arguably one of the most important and common data structures you use and
      encounter to solve algorithmic coding challenges.
    </p>
    <h3 id="hash-tables-ii">Hash Tables II <a id="hash-tables-ii"></a></h3>
    <p>
      In this module, you will learn about hash collisions and implement a
      complete hash table in Python that takes collisions into account.
    </p>
    <h3 id="searching-and-recursion">
      Searching and Recursion <a id="searching-and-recursion"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      This module will teach about logarithms, linear search, binary search, and
      recursion. This material sets the stage for learning about traversal
      techniques of trees and graphs. Additionally, using a binary search is a
      common optimization technique that may come up during a technical
      interview.
